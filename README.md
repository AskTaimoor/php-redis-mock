# php-redis-mock
A simple PHP Redis Mock with very basic functionality.

Made this script to mimic Redis behavour when I was unable to setup Redis on a legacy linux server :/

This script does nothing fancy and its only for sets and gets.

If you are looking for something with full fledge Redis features, GitHub is full of such scripts.

Will add more features when I get some free time.
